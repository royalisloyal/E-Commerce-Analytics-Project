## üë®‚Äçüíª Data Analyst Project: E-Commerce Analytics Retail Simulation (PostgreSQL)

# Project Overview

I designed and analyzed a comprehensive e-commerce dataset  to simulate real-world business challenges faced by Amazon-style retailers. This end-to-end analytics project leverages **PostgreSQL** to extract actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

##  Dataset Cleaning Steps

I performed comprehensive data cleaning on the dataset, including:

- **Removing duplicates**:
  - Identified and removed duplicate entries in customer and order tables
  - Implemented validation checks to prevent future duplicates

- **Handling missing values**:
  - Addressed null values in critical business fields
  - Applied context-specific solutions for different data types
 
# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:

- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance

## This project enabled me to:

- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, and joins.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.
